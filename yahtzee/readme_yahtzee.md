# Yahtzee Game/ Scorer

The plan here is to have Yahtzee in 2 forms:
- as a command line game, where the computer rolls the dice for an unspecified number of players and track the score
- as a scorer that can be used to support game play and track an unspecified number of players scores

My game design begins with a list comprehension to determine the computer dice roll.
