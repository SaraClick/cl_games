# Command Line Games

A selection of command line games in python to demonstrate programming knowledge and ability to use a shell.

**Using Linux Shell**
- I have used Github Codespaces, Gitbash and Powershell to familiarise myself with Linux command line and to create this repo, edit this readme file and create the file structure from the command line, rather than within my IDE's (VSCode and PyCharm).

**Rock, Paper, Scissors**

- A small command line game that has multiple functions linking across 2 files, using imported modules (sys, time). 
- The game has an in-game message dictionary that is separate from the code where game messages can be edited without needing to trawl through the code. 
- The code also demonstrates my programming knowledge of **kwargs, tuple unpacking and positionally based arguments in function parameters.

    - Link to [specific game readme](./rps/README_rps.md)

## Instructions for Use:
To play the games, run
```bash
python core_game_rps.py
```
