# Command Line Games

A selection of command line games in python to demonstrate programming knowledge.

**Rock, Paper, Scissors**

- A small command line game that has multiple functions linking across 2 files, using imported modules (sys, time). 
- The game has an in-game message dictionary that is separate from the code where game messages can be edited without needing to trawl through the code. 
- The code also demonstrates my programming knowledge of **kwargs, tuple unpacking and positionally based arguments in function parameters.
    - Link to [core game code](./rps/core_game_rps.py)
    - Link to [RPS Feature Details](./rps/README_rps.md)

## Instructions to play:
**Rock, Paper, Scissors** run:
```bash
python core_game_rps.py
```

Challenges Overcome:
- forgetting to create .gitignore after creating command line repo, and listing my entire venv for commit!
