# Yahtzee Game/ Scorer

The plan here is to have Yahtzee in 2 forms:
- as a command line game, where the computer rolls the dice for an unspecified number of players and track the score
- as a scorer that can be used to support game play and track an unspecified number of players scores

My game design begins with a list comprehension to determine the computer dice roll.

PLAN:
- Create a score sheet
- Create a score calculator
- Use it to score a single roll
- select best score and identify that result
- Add ability to enter own dice rolled into calculator

Add a game:
- Create a score tracker
- create a system to record the best result possible from each play given the previous scores tracked

Add multiple players:
